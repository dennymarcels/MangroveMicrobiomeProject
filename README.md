# MangroveMicrobiomeProject
This repository contains the code run in the publication [[to be announced - in revision process]].

The publication deals with microbial community structures present in a mangrove in Paranagu√° Bay, Southern Brazil. We unravel the most common community structures present, then establish the environmental factors that correlate with such structures, and later compare them with community from other biomes such as sea sediment, estuarine water and forest soils.
